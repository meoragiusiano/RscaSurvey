      "Adam Steagal is gifted. Although he is just three years old, he has mastered addition, subtraction, multiplication and basic division, and is even able to solve the Rubik’s Cube. Early in his life, Adam’s parents had a hunch that he was unusual. \n\nWhen he was ten months old, Adam’s parents brought him to the University of Michigan’s Unit for Intelligence Research (UIR). Paula Rescorla, the director of UIR, found that Adam had an analytic IQ of 185. Analytic IQ specifically measures the parts of intelligence associated with spatial and abstract reasoning, the building blocks of mathematical and scientific achievement. Like the standard IQ, experts consider an analytic IQ of 130 “very superior.” Adam’s analytic IQ is so extreme that only one person in a million has an IQ that even comes close. Researchers like Rescorla are keenly interested in what made Adam so smart.\n\nThe traditional “is it heredity or is it environment?” question is battered around the halls of UIR daily. But, people who take the side that intelligence is genetically determined are going to be believed less and less. Current research shows that analytic intelligence can be increased substantially by environmental factors.\n\nIn the past decade, a number of comprehensive studies have been published in the United States and in Europe. These studies provide the clearest answers so far in the ongoing debate. The most significant of these studies will be published this fall in Psychological Review, a prestigious journal published in the United States.\n\nJohn Knowles, the author of the article and a professor at Harvard, concludes that “analytic intelligence, and particularly math and science abilities, seem to have a minimal genetic component. People may be born with a given level of intelligence and abilities, but we see increases in IQs up to 50 points when people enter stimulating environments.”\n\nKnowles spent the last decade tracing identical twins who were raised apart. In a relentless search through Latin America, Africa, and North America, he was able to locate 83 pairs of twins who were raised separately. These twins ranged in age from 7 to 51 and came from all economic levels.\n\nKnowles had an ideal sample to study the nature-nurture question. The twins in his study were often reared in different cities by parents of different social classes. The various pairs of twins came from different countries, spoke different languages, were different ages, and he followed them for ten years. Knowles tested the subjects individually with the best “culture-fair” intelligence tests available: analytic intelligence tests.\n\nCulture-fair tests measure analytic and reasoning abilities by having people identify relationships between shapes, objects, and numbers alone. Because the tests don’t need to use words to measure analytic intelligence, cultural factors don’t influence people’s scores. Consequently, they provide a much more accurate measure than most other tests. In addition, culture-fair tests don’t discriminate against any ethnic groups. Because Knowles used these sophisticated measures of analytic intelligence, he was able to make stronger conclusions than have been possible in the past.\n\nHe found that twins raised apart in different environments had very different levels of analytic intelligence. According to Knowles’ results, up to 88 percent of a person’s math and reasoning skills are due to environmental factors. In his study, if twins were raised in stimulating environments with motivated parents, they tended to have high analytic IQs. Twins raised in unstimulating environments tended to have lower IQs. In an extreme case, a young girl adopted by a college professor and his wife had an analytic IQ of 138. The genetically identical twin was raised by the real mother who was a prostitute. This girl had an analytic IQ of only 85.\n\nAccording to Knowles, his results suggest that “the brilliance of Pythagoras and Einstein was probably due to challenging environment. Their genius had little to do with their DNA. These men are truly admirable because they were challenged and worked to overcome obstacles.”\n\nOther researchers are finding similar results. Hans Eysenck recently published an article supporting Knowles research, based on a series of 5 studies that show that a person’s level of motivation can have a profound effect on analytic intelligence.\n\nNeedless to say, Knowles’ and Eysenck’s research is drawing much attention from other psychologists. Their findings are a blow to researchers who have spent years arguing that these math and analytic abilities are due solely to genetic factors.\n\nLeo Kamin of Princeton University is one such researcher. In the 1960s and ‘70s he argued strongly that there was no good evidence to show the link between analytic intelligence and genetics. He helped prove that Sir Cyril Burt, a now infamous intelligence researcher, faked his data to show that analytic intelligence was inherited. When Burt was alive, he was knighted in England for his research. When Kamin examined Burt’s results, he discovered serious flaws that could only have resulted by faking the data.\n\nThis experience has made him highly skeptical of any research that establishes a relationship between intelligence and a person’s genes. Because of this, he carefully examined Knowles’ study. He says he found “no flaws in [Knowles’] methods or his analysis. Finally, the best available research shows what I have been arguing for 25 years. Knowles’ research is simply the best, and it shows that intelligence can be increased by stimulating environments.”\n\nPaula Rescorla at the University of Michigan’s UIR is excited about Eysenck’s and Knowles’ results. “I think absolutely critical things have come out of these studies. Math and reasoning abilities are something that motivated people can acquire and this idea will revolutionize education in the twenty-first century. We can help motivated children find environments that will help them increase their abilities.\n\nThree year-old genius Adam Steagal seems to be in an ideal environment right now. His young brilliance is being challenged by fascinating toys and games. If what the researchers say is true, there is a good chance that Steagal will have the motivation and passion to be a leader in the STEM fields in about the year 2025.",

    title: "Is the Natural Gas-Fossil Fuels Controversy Resolved?",
    author: "Dr. E. A. Goodey",
    contents:
      'Natural gas, with its reputation as a linchpin in the effort to wean the nation off dirtier fossil fuels and reduce global warming, may not be as clean, over all, as its proponents say.\n\nEven as natural gas production in the United States increases and Washington gives it a warm embrace as a crucial component of America’s energy future, two recent studies try to poke holes in the clean-and-green reputation of natural gas. They suggest that the rush to develop the nation’s vast, unconventional sources of natural gas is logistically impractical and will likely to do more to heat up the planet than mining and burning coal.\n\nThe problem, the studies suggest, is that planet-warming methane, the chief component of natural gas, is escaping into the atmosphere in far larger quantities than previously thought, with as much as 7.9 percent of it puffing out from shale gas wells, intentionally vented or flared, or seeping from loose pipe fittings along gas distribution lines. This offsets natural gas’s most important advantage as an energy source: it burns cleaner than other fossil fuels and releases lower carbon dioxide emissions. "The old dogma of natural gas being better than coal in terms of greenhouse gas emissions gets stated over and over without qualification," said Robert Howarth, a professor of ecology and environmental biology at Cornell University and the lead author of one of the studies. Mr. Howarth said his analysis, which looked specifically at methane leakage rates in unconventional shale gas development, was among the first of its kind and that much more research was needed.\n\n"I don’t think this is the end of the story," said Mr. Howarth, who is an opponent of growing gas development in western New York. "I think this is just the beginning of the story, and before governments and the industry push ahead on gas development, at the very least we ought to do a better job of making measurements."\n\nThe findings are certain to stir debate. For much of the last decade, the natural gas industry has carefully cultivated a green reputation, often with the help of environmental groups that embrace the resource as a clean-burning "bridge fuel" to a renewable energy future. The industry argues that it has vastly reduced the amount of fugitive methane with new technologies and upgraded pipe fittings and other equipment.\n\nMark D. Whitley, a senior vice president for engineering and technology with Range Resources, a gas drilling company with operations in several regions of the country, said the losses suggested by Mr. Howarth’s study were simply too high. "These are huge numbers," he said. "That the industry would let what amounts to trillions of cubic feet of gas get away from us doesn’t make any sense. That’s not the business that we’re in."\n\nNatural gas is already the principal source of heat in half of American households. Advocates have also long sought to promote it as a substitute for coal in electricity generation or gasoline in a new generation of natural gas cars. And the development of new ways to tap reserves of natural gas means production is likely to increase sharply.\n\nTwo weeks ago, President Obama included natural gas in his vision for America. A White House spokesperson, said that the administration’s energy priorities were not about picking one energy source over another, but about diversifying the nation’s energy mix. "This process will continue to be based on the best science available to ensure our energy sources, including our nation’s natural gas reserves, are developed safely and responsibly," the spokesperson said on Friday.\n\nThe ability to pull natural gas economically from previously inaccessible formations deep underground has made huge quantities of the resource available in wide areas of the country, including Texas, Louisiana, Pennsylvania, New York, Wyoming, and Colorado.\n\nSuch unconventional gas production accounts for nearly a quarter of total production in the United States, according to the latest figures from the Energy Information Administration. That is expected to reach 45 percent by 2035.\n\nBut the cleanliness of natural gas is largely based on its lower carbon dioxide emissions when burned. It emits roughly half the amount of carbon dioxide as coal and about 30 percent less than oil.\n\nLess clear, largely because no one has bothered to look, are the emissions over its entire production life cycle — that is, from the moment a well is plumbed to the point at which the gas is used.\n\nMethane leaks have long been a concern because while methane dissipates in the atmosphere more quickly than carbon dioxide, it is far more efficient at trapping heat. Recent evidence has suggested that the amount of leakage has been underestimated. A report in January by the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica, for example, noted that the Environmental Protection Agency had recently doubled its estimates for the amount of methane that is vented or lost from natural gas distribution lines.\n\nA spokesman for Energy in Depth, a coalition of independent oil and natural gas producers, dismissed Mr. Howarth as an advocate who is opposed to hydraulic-fracturing or "fracking," a practice associated with unconventional gas development involving the high-pressure injection of water, sand and chemicals deep underground to break up shale formations and release gas deposits. Mr. Howarth said his credentials as a scientist spoke for themselves.\n\nMr. Howarth included methane losses associated with flow-back and drill-out processes in hydraulic fracturing and other unconventional gas drilling techniques.\n\nThe study combined these emissions with studies of other methane losses along the processing and distribution cycle to arrive at an estimated total methane loss range from 3.6 to 7.9 percent for the shale gas industry.\n\nThe researchers include a recent study from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA suggesting that an interaction of methane with certain aerosol particles significantly amplifies methane’s already potent greenhouse gas effects, particularly over a 20-year time horizon. When all is factored together, Mr. Howarth and his colleagues conclude that the greenhouse gas footprint of shale gas can be as much as 20 percent greater than, and perhaps twice as high as, coal per unit of energy.\n\nDavid Hughes, a geoscientist and research fellow at the Post Carbon Institute, an energy and climate research organization in California, used Mr. Howarth’s research as part of a broader look at natural gas as a substitute for coal in electricity generation and oil in transportation.\n\nMr. Hughes’s full report is scheduled to be released in May, but in a draft version Mr. Hughes suggested that while natural gas would play an important role in the nation’s energy mix, both cases were practical impossibilities.',
